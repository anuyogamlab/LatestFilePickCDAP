# Plugin to Pick Latest File/Folder in SFTP

This action plugin extracts the latest ingested folder/file in the SFTP directory to pass it to the pipeline. 

## Build
To build your plugins manually:
mvn clean package

## Makefile</BR>
This project has a Makefile to build and deploy the plugin </BR>
You can run 'make'</BR>
You can run 'make build' to build without running tests</BR>

The build will create a .jar and .json file under the target directory. These files can be uploaded to CDAP to deploy your plugins.

## UI Integration
The CDAP Pipelines UI displays each plugin property as a simple textbox. To customize how the plugin properties are displayed in the UI, you can place a configuration file in the widgets directory. The file must be named following a convention of [plugin-name]-[plugin-type].json.

See Plugin Widget Configuration for details on the configuration file.

The UI will also display a reference doc for your plugin if you place a file in the docs directory that follows the convention of [plugin-name]-[plugin-type].md.

When the build runs, it will scan the widgets and docs directories in order to build an appropriately formatted .json file under the target directory. This file is deployed along with your .jar file to add your plugins to CDAP.

## Deployment

You can deploy your plugins using the CDAP CLI:

    > load artifact <target/plugin.jar> config-file <target/plugin.json>

For example, if your artifact is named 'example-plugins-1.0.0':

    > load artifact target/example-plugins-1.0.0.jar config-file target/example-plugins-1.0.0.json
